<h1>xv6 book</h1>
<h2>DRAFT: DO NOT CIRCULATE</h2>

very much in progres<br><br>

Introduction yet to be written.<br>
<ul>
<li>read with the code side by side
<li>code references look like (xxxx) or (xxxx-yyyy) in small text.
<li><a href="xv6-code.pdf">this pdf</a> is the one with matching line numbers.
<li>each chapter starts with an introduction to the topic,
spends most of the text on code,
and then wraps up talking about how xv6
compares to real-world operating systems.
</ul>
