<h1>xv6: a teaching operating system</h1>

<h2>xv6</h2>

Xv6 is a teaching operating system developed in the summer of 2006 for
MIT's operating systems course, &ldquo;6.828: Operating Systems
Engineering.&rdquo; We hope that xv6 will be useful in other courses
too.  This page collects resources to aid the use of xv6 in other
courses, including a commentary on the source code itself.

<font color="red">Status: The xv6 code is in pretty good shape, but the
commentary is rough.</font>

<h2>History and Background</h2>
For many years, MIT had no operating systems course.
In the fall of 2002, Frans Kaashoek, Josh Cates, and Emil Sit
created a new, experimental course (6.097)
to teach operating systems engineering.
In the course lectures, the class worked through Sixth Edition Unix (aka V6)
using John Lions's famous commentary.
In the lab assignments, students wrote most of an exokernel operating
system, eventually named Jos, for the Intel x86.
Exposing students to multiple systems&ndash;V6 and Jos&ndash;helped
develop a sense of the spectrum of operating system designs.
In the fall of 2003, the experimental 6.097 became the
official course 6.828; the course has been offered each fall since then.
<br><br>
V6 presented pedagogic challenges from the start.
Students doubted the relevance of an obsolete 30-year-old operating system
written in an obsolete programming language (pre-K&R C)
running on obsolete hardware (the PDP-11).
Students also struggled to learn the low-level details of two different
architectures (the PDP-11 and the Intel x86) at the same time.
By the summer of 2006, we had decided to replace V6
with a new operating system, xv6, modeled on V6
but written in ANSI C and running on multiprocessor
Intel x86 machines.
Xv6's use of the x86 makes it more relevant to
students' experience than V6 was
and unifies the course around a single architecture.
Adding multiprocessor support requires handling concurrency head on with
locks and threads (instead of using special-case solutions for
uniprocessors such as
enabling/disabling interrupts) and helps relevance.
Finally, writing a new system allowed us to write cleaner versions
of the rougher parts of V6, like the scheduler and file system.
<br><br> 6.828 substituted xv6 for V6 in the fall of 2006.  Based on
that experience, we cleaned up rough patches of xv6.  Since then, xv6
has stabilized, so we are making it available in the hopes that others
will find it useful too.
<br><br>
6.828 uses both xv6 and Jos.
Courses taught at UCLA, NYU, Peking University, Stanford, Tsinghua,
and University Texas (Austin) have used
Jos without xv6; we believe other courses could use
xv6 without Jos, though we are not aware of any that have.

<h2>Xv6 sources</h2>
The latest xv6 is <a href="xv6-rev2.tar.gz">xv6-rev2.tar.gz</a>.
We distribute the sources in electronic form but also as
a printed booklet with line numbers that keep everyone
together during lectures.  The booklet is available as
<a href="xv6-rev2.pdf">xv6-rev2.pdf</a>.
The xv6 source code is licensed under the traditional <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>;
see the LICENSE file in the source distribution.
<br><br>
xv6 compiles using the GNU C compiler,
targeted at the x86 using ELF binaries.
On BSD and Linux systems, you can use the native compilers;
On OS X, which doesn't use ELF binaries,
you must use a cross-compiler.
Xv6 does boot on real hardware, but typically
we run it using the Bochs emulator.
Both the GCC cross compiler and Bochs
can be found on the <a href="../../2007/tools.html">6.828 tools page</a>.

<h2>xv6 lecture material</h2>

In 6.828, the lectures in the first half of the course introduce the
PC hardware, the Intel x86, and then xv6.  The lectures in the second
half consider advanced topics using research papers; for some, xv6
serves as a useful base for making discussions concrete.  The lecture
notes are available from the 6.828 schedule page, and the chapters of
the commentary are below.

<h2>Feedback</h2>
If you are interested in using xv6 or have used xv6 in a course,
we would love to hear from you.
If there's anything that we can do to make xv6 easier
to adopt, we'd like to hear about it.
We'd also be interested to hear what worked well and what didn't.
