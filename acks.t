This manuscript is a draft text intended for a class on operating systems. It
covers the important operating sytems concepts by studying an example operating
system, named xv6.  xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken
Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of
v6, but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

The text is is supposed be read along with the source code for xv6. An approach
inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer to Peer
Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000)). See also
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2007/v6.html, which provides pointers to on-line
resources for v6.

We have used the text in 6.828, the operating system class at MIT.  We thank the
faculty, TAs, and students of 6.828 who all directly or indirectly contributed
to xv6.  In particular, we would like to thank Austin Clement and Nickolai
Zeldovich.
